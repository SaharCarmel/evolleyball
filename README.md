# evolleyball - your volleyball analytics companion

evolleyball is an open source project intended to bring analytical capabilities to the volleyball world. 
As a volleyball player and a data lover I wanted to create a tool that can provide valuable insights about 
my matches and games. 

Feel free to contact me and post issues and features request.
